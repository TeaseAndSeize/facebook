HomePoliciesFacebook Community StandardsThe Facebook Community Standards outline what is and isn't allowed on Facebook. IntroductionEvery day, people use Facebook to share their experiences, connect with friends and family, and build communities. It's a service for more than 2 billion people to freely express themselves across countries and cultures and in dozens of languages.Meta recognises how important it is for Facebook to be a place where people feel empowered to communicate, and we take our role seriously in keeping abuse off the service. That's why we developed standards for what is and isn't allowed on Facebook.These standards are based on feedback from people and the advice of experts in fields such as technology, public safety and human rights. To ensure that everyone's voice is valued, we take great care to create standards that include different views and beliefs, especially from people and communities that might otherwise be overlooked or marginalised.Please note that the US English version of the Community Standards reflects the most up-to-date set of the policies and should be used as the primary document. Our commitment to voiceThe goal of our Community Standards is to create a place for expression and give people a voice. Meta wants people to be able to talk openly about the issues that matter to them, whether through written comments, photos, music or other artistic mediums, even if some may disagree or find them objectionable. In some cases, we allow content – which would otherwise go against our standards – if it's newsworthy and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm, and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments. In other cases, we may remove content that uses ambiguous or implicit language when additional context allows us to reasonably understand that the content goes against our standards.Our commitment to expression is paramount, but we recognise that the Internet creates new and increased opportunities for abuse. For these reasons, when we limit expression, we do it in service of one or more of the following values: AuthenticityWe want to make sure that the content people see on Facebook is authentic. We believe that authenticity creates a better environment for sharing, and that's why we don't want people using Facebook to misrepresent who they are or what they're doing.SafetyWe're committed to making Facebook a safe place. We remove content that could contribute to a risk of harm to the physical security of persons. Content that threatens people has the potential to intimidate, exclude or silence others and isn't allowed on Facebook.PrivacyWe're committed to protecting personal privacy and information. Privacy gives people the freedom to be themselves, choose how and when to share on Facebook and connect more easily.DignityWe believe that all people are equal in dignity and rights. We expect that people will respect the dignity of others and not harass or degrade others. Community StandardsOur Community Standards apply to everyone all around the world, and to all types of content.Each section of our Community Standards starts with a "policy rationale" that sets out the aims of the policy followed by specific policy lines that outline:  Content that's not allowed; and  Content that requires additional information or context to enforce on, content that is allowed with a warning screen or content that is allowed but can only be viewed by adults aged 18 and older.
